# pdfPASS
Python Analysis Software Suite for the analysis of matrix elements extracted from Lattice QCD calculations,
mostly related to hadron Parton Distribution Functions, or PDFs.

This package will consist mostly on self-concise Jupyter-notebook Python scripts that perform the various analyses.
The input to these scripts are the two- and three-point functions produced from the Chroma and Redstar packages.
