# pdfPASS
Python Analysis Software Suite for the analysis of matrix elements extracted from Lattice QCD calculations,
mostly related to hadron Parton Distribution Functions, or PDFs.

## Description

This package will use the Jupyter-notebook application to perform the various analyses using Python.
The input is two- and three-point functions produced from the Chroma and Redstar packages.
The purpose of this package is to provide a means of preliminary analysis and plotting results, not paying particular attention to optimization and design.
